# Introduction

This language provides a faster alternative to writing code for the BES-8 than assembly language. It aims to offer improved productivity and readability while maintaining performance.

## Expressions

Expressions in this language are fundamental building blocks of code, representing computations or operations on data.

## Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on one or more operands. They are the building blocks for creating expressions.

## Keywords

Keywords are reserved words in the language that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers.

### Literals

#### word

A word is a literal representing a number with a size ranging from 0 to 16 bits.

``` BEc
syntax
word Number = 65535; // Declaring a word variable named Number with a value of 65535
```

#### byte

A byte is a literal representing a number with a size ranging from 0 to 8 bits.

``` BEc
syntax
byte ByteValue = 127; // Declaring a byte variable named ByteValue with a value of 127
```

#### long

A long is a literal representing a number with a size ranging from 0 to 20 bits.

``` BEc
syntax
long LongNumber = 10000; // Declaring a long variable named LongNumber with a value of 10000
```

#### ptr

A ptr is a literal representing a pointer. It allows the user to set the pointer to a memory address within the specified range (0x9000 to 0x8FFF).

``` BEc
syntax
ptr MemoryPointer = 0x9000; // Initializing a pointer named MemoryPointer to 0x9000
MemoryPointer = 1234; // Storing the value 1234 at the memory address pointed by MemoryPointer
MemoryPointer = new ptr 0x9001; // Reinitiating the pointer to point at 0x9001
MemoryPointer = new ptr nullptr; // Freeing the pointer by assigning nullptr
```

#### char

A char is an 8-bit value that can hold an ASCII character.

``` BEc
syntax
char Character = 'A'; // Declaring a char variable named Character with the value 'A'
```

## Statements

Statements are executable units of code that perform actions. They are the building blocks for constructing programs in this language.

### if, else if, else

Conditional statements that allow the execution of different blocks of code based on specified conditions.

``` BEc
syntax
int condition = /* some value */;

if (condition == 0) {
    // Code block executed if 'condition' is equal to 0
} else if (condition == 1) {
    // Code block executed if 'condition' is equal to 1
} else {
    // Code block executed if 'condition' is neither 0 nor 1
}
```

### return

A return statement is used to exit a function and return a value.

``` BEc
syntax
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### continue

The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.

``` BEc
syntax
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        continue; // Skip even numbers
    }
    // Code here will be skipped for even values of i
}
```

### break

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely.

``` BEc
syntax
while (true) {
    // Code here will be executed indefinitely
    if (/* some condition */) {
        break; // Exit the loop if the condition is met
    }
}
```

### for

The `for` statement is used for iterative control flow, often for looping through a range of values.

``` BEc
syntax
for (word i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    // Code block executed five times
}
```

### while

The `while` statement is used for repetitive execution of a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

``` BEc
syntax
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    // Code block executed as long as i is less than 5
    ++i;
}
```

## Standard Library

The Standard Library in this programming language includes a set of predefined functions, constants, and types that developers can leverage to simplify common tasks and enhance code readability.

### bool

A bool is a boolean literal representing true or false.

``` BEc
syntax
bool Bool = false;
bool TrueBool = true;
```

### Constants

#### nullptr

The nullptr constant is a special value initialized to zero and is used to represent a null pointer. When assigned to a pointer, it signifies that the pointer does not point to any valid memory location.

``` BEc
syntax
ptr Running = nullptr; // Initializing the pointer Running to a null value
```

#### true

``` BEc
syntax
const long trueValue = 1; // Declaring a constant named trueValue with a value of 1
```

#### false

``` BEc
syntax
const long falseValue = 0; // Declaring a constant named falseValue with a value of 0
```
