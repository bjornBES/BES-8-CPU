Introduction
This language is a faster way to write code to the BES-8 then assembly.  
contains
nullptr 
the nullptr is a constant that has been initiated to zero and will delete a pointer.

nullptr = new ptr 0 

data types
int
    number from 0 to 16 bits

    syntax
    int Name = value
long int
    number from 0 to 32 bits

    syntax
    long int Name = value
ptr
    this is a pointer, the user can set the point from 0x9000 to 0x8FFF

    syntax
    ; initiate 
    ptr int Name = 9000h        // here we initiate an int pointer to 9000 hex
    ptr Name = 9000h            // here we initiate a pointer to 9000 hex casted as an int

    ; setting a value to the pointed address
    ptr int Running = 9000h     // here we initiate the Running pointer to point at 9000 hex

    Running = 1234              // here we store 1234 to the pointed address the Running pointer

    ; reinitiate
    Running = new ptr 9001h     // here we reinitiate the Running pointer to point at 9001 hex

    ; freeing a pointer
    Running = new ptr nullptr
char
    a char is an 8 bit value, it can be hold an ascii char

    syntax
