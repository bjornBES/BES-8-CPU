Introduction

This language provides a faster alternative to writing code for the BES-8 than assembly language. It aims to offer improved productivity and readability while maintaining performance.

Expressions

Expressions in this language are fundamental building blocks of code, representing computations or operations on data.

Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on one or more operands. They are the building blocks for creating expressions.

Literals

word
A word is a literal representing a number with a size ranging from 0 to 16 bits.

syntax
word Number = 65535; // Declaring a word variable named Number with a value of 65535


byte
A byte is a literal representing a number with a size ranging from 0 to 8 bits.

syntax
byte ByteValue = 127; // Declaring a byte variable named ByteValue with a value of 127


long
A long is a literal representing a number with a size ranging from 0 to 20 bits.

syntax
long LongNumber = 10000; // Declaring a long variable named LongNumber with a value of 10000


bool
A bool is a boolean literal representing true or false.

syntax
bool Bool = false;
bool TrueBool = true;


ptr
A ptr is a literal representing a pointer. It allows the user to set the pointer to a memory address within the specified range (0x9000 to 0x8FFF).

syntax
ptr MemoryPointer = 0x9000; // Initializing a pointer named MemoryPointer to 0x9000
MemoryPointer = 1234; // Storing the value 1234 at the memory address pointed by MemoryPointer
MemoryPointer = new ptr 0x9001; // Reinitiating the pointer to point at 0x9001
MemoryPointer = new ptr nullptr; // Freeing the pointer by assigning nullptr


char
A char is an 8-bit value that can hold an ASCII character.

syntax
char Character = 'A'; // Declaring a char variable named Character with the value 'A'


Keywords

Keywords are reserved words in the language that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers.

if, else if, else
Conditional statements that allow the execution of different blocks of code based on specified conditions.

syntax
int condition = /* some value */;

if (condition == 0) {
    // Code block executed if 'condition' is equal to 0
} else if (condition == 1) {
    // Code block executed if 'condition' is equal to 1
} else {
    // Code block executed if 'condition' is neither 0 nor 1
}


Statements

Statements are executable units of code that perform actions. They are the building blocks for constructing programs in this language.

Standard Library

The Standard Library in this programming language includes a set of predefined functions, constants, and types that developers can leverage to simplify common tasks and enhance code readability.

Constants

nullptr

The nullptr constant is a special value initialized to zero and is used to represent a null pointer. When assigned to a pointer, it signifies that the pointer does not point to any valid memory location.

syntax
ptr Running = nullptr; // Initializing the pointer Running to a null value


true

syntax
const long trueValue = 1; // Declaring a constant named trueValue with a value of 1


false

syntax
const long falseValue = 0; // Declaring a constant named falseValue with a value of 0
