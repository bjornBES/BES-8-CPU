Overview: 
The system encompasses 1 megabyte of data distributed over 27 address lines,
each carrying 16 bits of data. The disk is divided into 65535 pages, 
each containing 2048 bytes. Each page is further split into 4 sectors,
each of which is 0x200 bytes in width.

Note: The first disk always serves as the boot disk and requires special bytes 
for proper functioning. Ensure there is a 0x55AA at the bottom 
of the first page user page of the disk to enable booting.

Reading instruction
1. write to the disk using OUT the Page     (if you writen in one of these before you dont need to write again)
2. write to the disk using OUT the sector
3. write to the disk using OUT the address
4. read the disk using IN

Writing instruction
1. write the disk using OUT the Page
3. write the disk using OUT the sector
5. write the disk using OUT the address
7. write the disk using OUT the data with the 16th bit set

Pages
page 0 is the metadata/file system data 
page 1 - 65533 is user defind
