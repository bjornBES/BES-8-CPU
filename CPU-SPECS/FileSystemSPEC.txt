Overview: 
The system encompasses 1 megabyte of data distributed over 20 address lines,
each carrying 16 bits of data. The disk is divided into 511 pages, 
each containing 2048 bytes. Each page is further split into 4 sectors,
each of which is 0x200 bytes in width.

Instructions:
Writing to Disk:
Write the address to the disk header port at 0x010 using `outb`.
In the low part, specify the sector you wish to write, 
and in the high data byte, indicate the disk.
Write the data to one of the 14 disks using `outb`.

Reading from Disk
Write the sector you wish to read to the disk header port at 0x010 using OUTB.
In the low part, specify the page you want to read, 
and in the high data byte, indicate the disk.
Read the data from memory at 0x10000 - 0x1FFFF in bank 2.

Note: The first disk always serves as the boot disk and requires special bytes 
for proper functioning. Ensure there is a 0x55AA at the bottom 
of the first page user page of the disk to enable booting.
